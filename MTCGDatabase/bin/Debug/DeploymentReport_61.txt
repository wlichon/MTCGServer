     Possible data issues
       The column [dbo].[MTCGCard].[isSpell] on table [dbo].[MTCGCard] must be added, but the column has no default value and
         does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid this issue you must
         either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults
         as a deployment option.

The column [dbo].[MTCGCard].[isSpell] on table [dbo].[MTCGCard] must be added, but the column has no default value and does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid this issue you must either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults as a deployment option.
The column Element on table [dbo].[MTCGCard] must be changed from NULL to NOT NULL. If the table contains data, the ALTER script may not work.

If this deployment is executed, changes to [dbo].[MTCGCard] might introduce run-time errors in [dbo].[CardOwners].
